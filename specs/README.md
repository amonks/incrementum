# Specifications

## Architecture

### System Principles

- The specifications are the source of truth for system behavior; update them alongside code changes.
- Keep the domain model coherent and favor clear factoring over shortcuts.
- Treat the system as single-version: remove or migrate old behavior instead of preserving backward compatibility.
- Practice test-driven development: write a failing test before implementing the behavior.
- Never mock: tests must exercise real integrations, especially when shelling out to third-party binaries.
- When you spot unrelated issues, capture them as new todos instead of piggybacking on the current change.

### Development Practices

- [testing.md](./testing.md) defines test tiers, testscript usage, and determinism rules.
- [perf.md](./perf.md) tracks benchmarks, profiling commands, and improvements.

### CLI Architecture

- The CLI is structured as a single entry point that dispatches subcommands.
- Subcommands validate inputs before performing state changes.
- Errors are reported consistently, using a human-readable message and a non-zero exit code.
- Commands follow the pattern `ii <noun> <verb> [args] [flags]`.
- The CLI layer is a thin wrapper around public packages; command handlers delegate to package APIs with minimal logic.
- Command interfaces should mirror the public APIs they wrap (1:1 when possible).
- Flag aliases should be handled via normalization so help shows a single entry; prefer `-d` and accept `--desc` for description when needed.

### CLI I/O & Testing

- Machine-readable output is only emitted when explicitly requested (for example via `--json`).
- Table output aligns and truncates by visible characters instead of raw byte length.
- Table output normalizes line breaks and tabs to spaces to keep rows single-line.
- Each package wrapped into the CLI has both regular tests and an end-to-end test that builds and executes the CLI binary.
- CLI e2e testscript suites live under `cmd/ii/testdata` and are executed from `cmd/ii/*_test.go`.
- CLI wrapper unit tests live under `cmd/ii`; go package APIs are tested in their respective module directories.
- Opencode integration tests copy the user's real config into a temp `XDG_CONFIG_HOME`, skipping when no config exists.

### No-Mock Test Audit

- 2026-01-24: Audited all `*_test.go` files under `cmd/ii`, `job`, `opencode`, `todo`, `workspace`, and `internal`; tests rely on real integrations or local helpers with no mock binaries.
- Opencode integration tests assert stdin prompt handling and confirm attach/event stream logs are recorded.
