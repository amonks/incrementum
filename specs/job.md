# Job Subcommand

## Overview

The job package and subcommand automate todo completion via opencode. A job
runs from the current working directory and executes a work loop: opencode is
asked to complete the next highest-priority step and write a commit message,
tests run, opencode reviews the change, and the result is committed. The loop
continues until opencode makes no changes, then the job skips tests and moves
directly to the final project review before completing. Jobs retry on test
failure or review rejection until opencode decides to abandon.

Jobs emit a merged stream of opencode and job events to the JSONL event log and
optionally to a caller-provided Go channel via `RunOptions.EventStream`, which
is closed when the run completes.

Jobs run from the repo root by default but can optionally use a separate
workspace path.

## Architecture

The job implementation lives in a Go package with clean exports; the `cmd/ii`
subcommand stays a thin wrapper that wires flags and delegates to the package.

## Testing

Follow our usual testing practice:

- Prefer lots of focused unit tests in `job/`.
- Add a handful of end-to-end testscript tests in `cmd/ii`.

## Storage

- Job state stored in `~/.local/state/incrementum/state.json` alongside other
  state.
- Jobs are scoped per repo using the same repo slug as other state.
- Jobs do not create sessions or workspaces.
- Job records track opencode sessions created during the job.
- Job event logs are stored as JSONL at
  `~/.local/share/incrementum/jobs/events/<job-id>.jsonl`.
- Job event entries use opencode's event shape (`id`, `name`, `data`) and include
  both opencode events and job-specific events (stage changes, prompts, opencode
  transcripts, test results, review feedback, commit messages, opencode session
  boundaries, opencode errors).

## Job Model

Fields (JSON keys):

- `id`: 8-character job id (hash of todo_id + timestamp).
- `repo`: repo slug.
- `todo_id`: full resolved todo id.
- `agent`: opencode agent name (empty string when unset).
- `stage`: `implementing`, `testing`, `reviewing`, `committing`.
- `feedback`: feedback from last failed stage (test results list or review
  feedback).
- `opencode_sessions`: list of `{"purpose": string, "id": string}` tracking
  opencode sessions created during this job.
- `changes`: list of changes created during this job (see
  [job-changes.md](./job-changes.md)).
- `project_review`: final project review outcome (see
  [job-changes.md](./job-changes.md)).
- `status`: `active`, `completed`, `failed`, `abandoned`.
- `created_at`: timestamp.
- `started_at`: timestamp.
- `updated_at`: timestamp.
- `completed_at`: timestamp.

## Agent Selection

- The opencode agent is resolved in this order: CLI override -> todo-level model
  for the stage -> config stage model -> config default agent.
- Todo-level fields map to stages: `implementation_model` for implementing,
  `code_review_model` for step review, `project_review_model` for project review.

## Feedback File

Opencode communicates review outcomes by writing to `.incrementum-feedback` in the
job workspace root (`WorkspacePath`).

Format:

```
<OUTCOME>

<details>
```

Where `<OUTCOME>` (first line, trimmed) is one of:

- `ACCEPT` - changes look good, proceed. Optionally followed by blank line and
  review comments noting what looks good or any observations. Comments are
  included in the commit message when present.
- `ABANDON` - task is impossible or misguided, give up. Must be followed by blank
  line and reason text explaining why the task is being abandoned.
- `REQUEST_CHANGES` - followed by blank line and feedback text.

If the file doesn't exist after review, treat as `ACCEPT` with no comments.

## Commit Message File

Opencode writes the generated commit message to `.incrementum-commit-message` in the
job workspace root (`WorkspacePath`) during the implementing stage. The commit
message should describe the entire working tree diff created in that stage.

## State Machine

```
implementing -> testing -> reviewing -> committing -> implementing
     ^             |            |           |
     |             |            |           +-> (continue work loop)
     |             |            +--------------> implementing (REQUEST_CHANGES)
     |             +--------------------------> implementing (test failure)
     |
     +-> (no changes) -> reviewing -> completed

reviewing -> abandoned (ABANDON)
any stage -> failed (unrecoverable error)
```

### implementing

1. Best-effort `jj workspace update-stale` in the repo working directory.
2. Delete `.incrementum-feedback` from the workspace root if it exists.
3. Record the current working copy commit id.
4. Run opencode with `prompt-implementation.tmpl` when no feedback is present,
   or `prompt-feedback.tmpl` when responding to feedback (PWD set to the
   workspace root). Set `OPENCODE_CONFIG_CONTENT` to a JSON config that:
   - Denies question prompts (`permission.question = "deny"`)
   - Allows all bash commands by default (`permission.bash["*"] = "allow"`)
   - Denies most jj commands (`permission.bash["jj *"] = "deny"`)
   - Allows read-only jj commands: `jj diff`, `jj file`, `jj log`, `jj show`
     and their variants with arguments
5. Template receives: `Todo`, `Feedback`, and `Message` (previous commit message
   when responding to feedback).
6. Best-effort `jj debug snapshot` in the repo working directory immediately
   before opencode runs.
7. Run opencode to completion.
8. Record opencode session in `opencode_sessions` with purpose `implement`.
9. If opencode returns an error before completion, record a `job.opencode.error`
   event with the purpose and error message, then mark the job `failed`.
10. If opencode fails (nonzero exit): mark job `failed` with an error that
    includes purpose, session id, agent, prompt template, opencode run/serve
    command lines, repo/workspace paths, before/after commit ids, and stderr
    output when available. If the exit code is negative and the working copy commit changed,
    best-effort restore the workspace to the pre-opencode commit and retry
    opencode once. If the retry still fails, best-effort restore before failing
    and include the retry attempt in the error details.
11. Record the current working copy commit id again.
12. If the commit id changed, run `jj log -r @ -T empty --no-graph` and treat a
    `true` result as no change (empty working copy) and `false` as changed.
13. If the commit id did not change (or the change is empty):
    - Delete `.incrementum-commit-message` from the workspace root if it exists.
    - Flag the next review cycle as the final project review.
14. If the commit id changed and the change is not empty:
    - Read `.incrementum-commit-message` from the workspace root, trimming trailing
      newlines, trailing whitespace on each line, and any leading blank lines.
    - Store the message for the committing stage.
15. Transition to `testing` when changes were detected, otherwise transition to
    `reviewing`.

### testing

1. Run each test command from config sequentially (only when changes were
   detected in the implementing stage).
2. Capture combined stdout/stderr output and exit code for each command.
3. Store the command, exit code, and output in the job test event log.
4. If any command fails (nonzero exit):
   - Build feedback as a markdown list with one entry per test command, using
     `- <command> is passing` or `- <command> is failing`.
   - Transition to `implementing`.
5. If all pass: transition to `reviewing`.
6. If the job was in final project review when tests failed, the next implementing
   stage restarts the work loop.

### reviewing

1. Best-effort `jj workspace update-stale` in the repo working directory.
2. Delete `.incrementum-feedback` from the workspace root if it exists.
3. Best-effort `jj debug snapshot` in the repo working directory immediately
   before opencode runs.
4. Run opencode with `OPENCODE_CONFIG_CONTENT` set as in the implementing
   stage (denies questions, allows bash except most jj commands) and:
   - `prompt-commit-review.tmpl` during the work loop, or
   - `prompt-project-review.tmpl` during the final project review.
5. Template receives: `Todo`, `Message` (commit message from the implementing stage).
   If the review template does not reference `Message` or `CommitMessageBlock`,
   the job appends a `Commit message` block with heading-and-indent formatting
   before rendering.
   - If the commit message is required for the step review and missing, fail with
     a descriptive error that calls out the opencode implementation prompt and
     expected `.incrementum-commit-message` location.
6. Template instructs opencode to inspect changes (or the commit sequence for
   project review) and write outcome to `.incrementum-feedback`.
7. Run opencode to completion.
8. Record opencode session in `opencode_sessions` with purpose `review` or
   `project-review`.
9. If opencode returns an error before completion, record a `job.opencode.error`
   event with the purpose and error message, then mark the job `failed`.
10. If opencode fails (nonzero exit): mark job `failed` with an error that
    includes purpose, session id, agent, prompt template, opencode run/serve
    command lines, repo/workspace paths, before/after commit ids, and stderr
    output when available.
11. Read `.incrementum-feedback` from the workspace root:
   - Delete `.incrementum-feedback` after reading.
   - Missing or first line is `ACCEPT`:
     - During the work loop: transition to `committing`.
     - During project review: mark job `completed`.
   - First line is `ABANDON`: extract reason (lines after first blank line),
     mark job `abandoned`, and return an error with the reason attached.
   - First line is `REQUEST_CHANGES`: extract feedback (lines after first blank
     line), transition to `implementing` and restart the work loop if needed.
   - Other first line: treat as invalid format, mark job `failed`.

### committing

1. Best-effort `jj workspace update-stale` in the repo working directory.
2. If the working copy diff (`jj diff --stat --from @- --to @`) is empty, skip
   committing and transition back to `implementing` (the next loop will detect
   no changes and move to project review). An output with no file stat lines or
   non-zero summary counts as empty.
3. Format final message with a fixed commit message layout (not templated). The
   format uses the opencode-generated summary/body plus a todo block, reflowed via
   the markdown renderer to 80/76/72 columns with 0/4/8-space indentation. Todo
   descriptions are rendered via the markdown renderer to preserve lists and code
   blocks.
4. Normalize the formatted message by trimming leading blank lines and trailing
   whitespace on each line. Left-trim the first non-blank line so the summary
   line starts at column 0 even if the markdown renderer indents paragraphs.
5. Best-effort `jj workspace update-stale` in the repo working directory.
6. Run `jj commit -m "<formatted message>"` in the repo working directory.
7. If commit fails: mark job `failed`.
8. Transition back to `implementing` to continue the work loop.

Commit message format:

```
<summary line>

Here is a generated commit message:

    <reflowed body>

Review comments:

    <review comments if present>

This commit is a step towards implementing this todo:

    ID: <id>
    Title: <title>
    Type: <type>
    Priority: <priority> (<name>)
    Description:
        <markdown-rendered description>
```

The "Review comments" section is only included when the reviewer provided comments
with their ACCEPT verdict.

## Failure Handling

- `failed`: unrecoverable error (commit fails, invalid feedback format).
- `abandoned`: opencode decided the task is impossible.

Both reopen the todo.

On interrupt (SIGINT), mark job `failed` and reopen the todo.

### Stale Job Detection

Active jobs that haven't been updated within 10 minutes are considered stale
(orphaned). When `ii job list` runs, it automatically marks stale active jobs
as `failed`. This handles cases where a job process crashed or was killed
without proper cleanup.

## Todo Status Updates

- Before running, mark the todo `in_progress`.
- When a job completes successfully, mark the todo `done`.
- When a job fails or is abandoned, reopen the todo (`open`).

## Config

```toml
[job]
agent = "gpt-5.2-codex"
implementation-model = "gpt-5.2-impl"
code-review-model = "gpt-5.2-review"
project-review-model = "gpt-5.2-project"
test-commands = [
  "go test ./...",
  "golangci-lint run",
]
```

`test-commands` must be configured with at least one entry; jobs fail in the
testing stage if it is missing or empty.

Config is loaded from `incrementum.toml` or `.incrementum/config.toml` and
`~/.config/incrementum/config.toml`; project values override global values.

Callers can supply a preloaded config via `RunOptions.Config` to avoid
filesystem reads; when set, the job runner does not call `LoadConfig`.

`agent` is an optional default for opencode runs; it is overridden by the
`--agent` flag and `INCREMENTUM_OPENCODE_AGENT`.

`implementation-model`, `code-review-model`, and `project-review-model` override
`agent` for their respective stages unless `--agent` or
`INCREMENTUM_OPENCODE_AGENT` are set.

## Templates

Bundled defaults via `//go:embed`, overridable by placing files in
`.incrementum/templates/` unless noted. Use `ii help templates` to print the
default template contents, override paths, and variable types for prompt
templates.

| File                             | Stage        | Mode   |
| -------------------------------- | ------------ | ------ |
| `prompt-implementation.tmpl`     | implementing | todo   |
| `prompt-feedback.tmpl`           | implementing | both   |
| `prompt-commit-review.tmpl`      | reviewing    | todo   |
| `prompt-project-review.tmpl`     | reviewing    | todo   |
| `prompt-habit-implementation.tmpl` | implementing | habit  |
| `prompt-habit-review.tmpl`       | reviewing    | habit  |

Templates use Go `text/template` syntax (commit messages are generated in code).

All prompt templates receive the same data:

- `Todo` (`todo.Todo`): `ID`, `Title`, `Description`, `Type`, `Priority`, `Status`,
  `CreatedAt`, `UpdatedAt`, `ClosedAt`, `DeletedAt`, `DeleteReason`.
- `Feedback` (`string`)
- `Message` (`string`)
- `CommitLog` (`[]CommitLogEntry`): list of commits recorded so far with fields `ID`
  and `Message`. The `Message` field contains only the draft commit message (summary
  and body) as written by opencode, not the fully formatted message with todo context
  and review comments.
- `OpencodeTranscripts` (`[]OpencodeTranscript`)
- `WorkspacePath` (`string`): absolute path to the job's workspace root.
- `ReviewInstructions` (`string`): standard review output instructions block.
- `TodoBlock` (`string`): formatted heading-and-indent block that includes ID, title,
  type, priority, and description; each field is on its own indented line and the
  description text is reflowed and indented one level deeper.
- `FeedbackBlock` (`string`): formatted heading-and-indent block for the feedback text.
- `CommitMessageBlock` (`string`): formatted heading-and-indent block for the commit
  message text.
- `HabitName` (`string`): name of the habit (filename without extension). Empty for
  regular todo jobs.
- `HabitInstructions` (`string`): full text of the habit instruction document,
  formatted as an indented block. Empty for regular todo jobs.

Shared templates:

- `review-questions.tmpl`: defines `review_questions`, the default review
  question list. Overrides live at `.incrementum/templates/review-questions.tmpl`.
- `review-instructions.tmpl`: embedded review output instructions block. This is
  part of the internal API and is not overrideable.

## Commands

### `ii job do [todo-id... | creation-flags | --habit [name]]`

Create and run a job to completion (blocking).

- If one or more todo-ids provided: run each existing todo in sequence.
- If creation flags provided: create todo first (same flags as `ii todo create`:
  `--title`, `--type`, `--priority`, `--description/--desc`, `--deps`,
  `--edit/--no-edit`).
- `--agent` selects the opencode agent and overrides `INCREMENTUM_OPENCODE_AGENT`
  and `job.agent`.
- `--habit <name>` runs the named habit from `.incrementum/habits/<name>.md`.
  Accepts habit name or unique prefix.
- `--habit` (no name) runs the alphabetically first habit.
- `--habit` cannot be combined with todo-ids or todo creation flags.
- If no args and interactive: open $EDITOR to create todo.
- If `--rev` is omitted, default to `trunk()`.

Behavior:

1. Resolve or create todo(s).
2. Release the todo store workspace once the todo is loaded.
3. Mark the todo `in_progress`.
4. Run the job from the workspace root (no session/workspace or new change is created).
5. Output job context: workdir and full todo details.
6. Create job record with status `active`, stage `implementing`.
7. Run state machine to completion.
8. Output progress: stage transitions and formatted logs (opencode event stream
   entries labeled and indented, tool start/end entries surfaced separately,
   prompts and commit messages rendered via the markdown renderer, opencode
   transcripts printed as preformatted logs with tool output preserved, test
   results, review feedback) with 80-column wrapping where formatting applies
   and 0/4/8-space indentation for document hierarchy. Opencode stdout/stderr is
   suppressed; use the formatted event logs instead.
9. On success: mark todo done and print final commit info with 80-column
   wrapping and 0/4/8-space indentation (todo descriptions are
   markdown-rendered).
10. On failure/abandon: reopen todo and print reason. For abandoned jobs, print
    the abandon reason with the same 80-column wrapping and indentation used for
    commit messages.

Exit codes:

- 0: completed.
- 1: failed or abandoned.

#### Habit Workflow

When `--habit` is provided, the workflow differs from regular todos:

1. Load instructions from `.incrementum/habits/<name>.md`.
2. Run implementation stage with `prompt-habit-implementation.tmpl` (or
   `prompt-feedback.tmpl` when responding to feedback).
3. Run testing stage (same as regular todos).
4. Run step review with `prompt-habit-review.tmpl`.
5. On ACCEPT: commit and create an artifact todo with `source: habit:<name>`.
6. On REQUEST_CHANGES: loop back to implementation with feedback.
7. On ABANDON: job completes successfully with no artifact (nothing worth doing
   right now is a valid outcome for habits).

Habits skip the project review stage. The commit message includes the full habit
instructions text.

### `ii job do-all [--priority <n>] [--type <type>]`

Run jobs for all ready todos that match the provided filters.

- `--priority` filters by maximum priority; `--priority=1` includes priority 0
  and 1 todos (priority 0 first).
- `--type` filters by exact todo type (`task`, `bug`, `feature`).

Behavior:

1. Read the ready todo list (open, unblocked), sorted by priority.
2. Select the first todo matching the filters.
3. Run `ii job do` for that todo.
4. Repeat from step 1 until no matching todos remain.
5. Print `nothing left to do` when the run finishes without a match.

### `ii job list [--status <s>] [--all] [--json]`

List jobs for current repo.

- Default: active jobs only.
- `--status`: filter by status (case-insensitive).
- `--all`: show all statuses.
- `--json`: structured output.

Columns: `JOB`, `TODO`, `STAGE`, `STATUS`, `IMPL`, `REVIEW`, `PROJECT`, `AGE`, `DURATION`, `TITLE`.

`IMPL`, `REVIEW`, and `PROJECT` show the opencode models used for
implementation, commit review, and project review.

`AGE` uses `now - created_at`.

`DURATION` uses `now - created_at` for active jobs, otherwise
`updated_at - created_at`.

`JOB` highlights the shortest unique prefix across all jobs in the repo.

`TODO` uses the same prefix highlighting as other todo output.

`SESSION` uses the shortest unique prefix across job session IDs in the repo.

When list is empty but jobs exist, print hint about `--all`.

### `ii job show <job-id>`

Show detailed job info.

Output includes:

- Job ID, status, stage.
- Todo ID and title.
- Feedback (if any).
- Opencode sessions with purposes.

### `ii job logs <job-id>`

Show the combined job event stream.

Reads the job's JSONL event log and prints entries in the order they were
recorded, formatting stage transitions and logs with the same 80-column reflow
and 0/4/8-space indentation used during `ii job do` output.
Opencode events are rendered as `Opencode event (<name>):` blocks with their
data indented beneath the label.
