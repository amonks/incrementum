# Clean Up

Look for code cleanup opportunities, but do not change CLI behavior.
(Changing how things are printed is fine, but invocations that did
something before should still do that thing after.)

## Guidelines

- Is there duplicated code?
- Is the domain model clear and well-factored?
- Is there needless inconsistency?
- Are things in the right places?
- Is error handling consistent and robust?
- Are we doing things that are not necessary?
