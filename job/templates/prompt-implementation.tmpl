{{else}}
You are implementing the next step of a todo.

Do the highest-priority remaining step toward resolution of the todo. Dot 'i's,
cross 't's, resolve the todo completely and correctly, but don't do additional
work that does not move us towards todo resolution. If the todo is already
complete, make no changes.

When you make changes, write a multi-line commit message to ./.incrementum-commit-message
Keep changes focused on the current step.
