You are implementing the next step of a todo.

Do the highest-priority remaining step toward resolution of the todo. Dot 'i's,
cross 't's, resolve the todo completely and correctly, but don't do additional
work that does not move us towards todo resolution. If the todo is already
complete, make no changes.

Changes are reviewed according to these questions:

{{template "review_questions"}}

When you make changes, write a detailed commit message to
./.incrementum-commit-message -- describe the what _and_ the why. Keep changes
focused on the current step.
