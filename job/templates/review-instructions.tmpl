Publish your review to the file ./.incrementum-feedback

Write one of the following allcaps words as the first line:
- `ACCEPT` -- if the changes pass review and should be merged
- `ABANDON` -- if the changes are so off-base as to be a lost cause

If requesting changes, add a blank line and the details after it.
