You are working on the '{{.HabitName}}' habit.

Habits are ongoing improvement work without completion state. Unlike regular
todos, habits are never "done" - they represent continuous practices. Find
something worth improving and implement it.

Changes are reviewed according to these questions:

{{template "review_questions"}}

When you make changes, write a detailed commit message to
./.incrementum-commit-message -- describe the what _and_ the why. Keep changes
focused on a single improvement.

If there's nothing worth doing right now, that's fine - make no changes and
write nothing to .incrementum-commit-message.
