You are implementing the next step of a todo.

Do the highest-priority remaining step toward resolution of the todo. Dot 'i's,
cross 't's, resolve the todo completely and correctly, but don't do additional
work that does not move us towards todo resolution. If the todo is already
complete, make no changes.

Changes are reviewed according to these questions:

- Does it do what the message says?
- Does it move us towards the goal in the todo?
- Is it _necessary_ for moving us towards the goal in the todo?
- Is it free of defects?
- Is the domain modeling coherent and sound?
- Are things in the right place?
- Does it include proper test coverage?
- Does it keep the relevant specs up to date?
- Does it conform to the norms of the code areas it modifies?
- Does it work?


When you make changes, write a detailed commit message for the entire working
tree diff to ./.incrementum-commit-message -- describe the what _and_ the why.
Keep changes focused on the current step.

Todo

    ID: todo-57uzut5r
    Title: Snapshot-test text formatting
    Type: task
    Priority: 1
    Description:
        Build snapshot tests for long-form output so regressions are obvious.
        Cover prompt rendering, commit message formatting, and log snapshots.
        Make sure wrapping handles long lines, bullets, and mixed indentation.
        
        - First bullet item has a long line that should wrap within the todo
        description block and keep indentation consistent. - Second bullet is
        shorter but still wraps when it needs to.
        
            Indented block line one should wrap and stay indented even when the
            line is long enough to exceed the width.
        
            Indented block line two continues with more words to force another
            wrap and confirm spacing.
