feat: snapshot long text

Here is a generated commit message:


      This adds snapshot coverage for prompt rendering and log snapshots. It
      includes long paragraphs that should wrap cleanly and a list:

      - First bullet is long enough to wrap and includes inline code to verify
      rendering.
      - Second bullet continues with more words to trigger wrapping within the
      configured width.

        go test ./... -run Snapshot
