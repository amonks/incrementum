          Checklist:
        
          This paragraph is deliberately long to confirm that markdown rendering
          wraps within the log width without losing spacing. It should break
          across multiple lines and still preserve paragraph boundaries.
        
          - First bullet item includes additional words to make sure wrapping
          happens after the bullet prefix.
          - Second bullet item is also long enough to wrap on the next line in
          the snapshot.

    Final commit message:
        feat: snapshot log output
        
        Keep this description long enough to wrap and include a short list:
        
        - Capture prompt formatting.
        - Preserve code fences.
        
        ```bash
        go test ./job -run Snapshot
        ```

    Opencode tool start: run 'rg "snapshot" -g "*.go" /tmp/workspaces/snapshot-test'
    Opencode tool end: run 'rg "snapshot" -g "*.go" /tmp/workspaces/snapshot-test'

          Review notes:
        
          - Update the snapshot file to match the current output.
          - Keep the description block long enough to wrap across lines in the
          snapshot output.
