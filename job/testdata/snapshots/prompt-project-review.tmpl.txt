    ID: todo-57uzut5r
    Title: Snapshot-test text formatting
    Type: task
    Priority: 1
    Description:
        Build snapshot tests for long-form output so regressions are obvious.
        Cover prompt rendering, commit message formatting, and log snapshots.
        Make sure wrapping handles long lines, bullets, and mixed indentation.
        
        - First bullet item has a long line that should wrap within the todo
        description block and keep indentation consistent. - Second bullet is
        shorter but still wraps when it needs to.
        
            Indented block line one should wrap and stay indented even when the
            line is long enough to exceed the width.
        
            Indented block line two continues with more words to force another
            wrap and confirm spacing.
